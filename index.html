						<h2><span class="section-number">01.</span> About Me</h2>
						<p>Hi! I'm Ben, a second year Computer Science student
							at the University of York. I decided I needed website
							as a central location to showcase the things I do, so
							here it is.</p>
						<p>
							Outside of my studies, I usually spend my time
							programming, working at <a href="https://rewindrl.uk" target="_blank">Rewind Gaming</a>, or
							playing
							in the University Jazz and Concert bands.
						</p>
						<p>My skills include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Javascript</li>
							<li>React</li>
							<li>Python</li>
							<li>HTML & S(CSS)</li>
							<li>Bootstrap</li>
							<li>Photoshop</li>

						<h2><span class="section-number">04.</span> Rewind Gaming</h2>
						<p>In 2016 I founded Rewind Gaming, a European esports organisation, with one of my
							friends and currently work there as Director of Operations. My responsiblities include
							negotiating partnerships with companies, as well as organising events and I've
							developed valuable skills in business and relationship management as a result of
							working with a broad range of other organisations in the competitive gaming industry.</p>
						<p>Rewind Gaming consists of around 40 volunteer staff working in a variety of areas from
							graphic design to commentating. I'm proud to have worked with Psyonix, the
							developers of Rocket League, on two separate events which were both a huge success.

						<p class="quote-content">Ben was a great partner and has an intuitive sense for client side
							relations. He was receptive to feedback, effective in his communication and strategy, and
							displayed agile management skills. The promotional esorts for 'The Colosseum' made by Rewind
							with him at the helm set quite a high bar for tournaments to come. I look forward to working
							with him again!
